# Phase 1 Project Description
#  Aviation Risk Analysis  

## Overview  
This project aims to assess aviation accident risks to guide business decisions for a company entering the aviation industry. Through data analysis, visualization, and risk assessment, we identify the safest aircraft for investment.  

## 📊 Business Understanding  
**Stakeholder:** Executive team of the aviation division  
**Key Business Questions:**  
- What aircraft models are associated with the highest accident risks?  
- Which flight phases have the most severe accidents?  
- How do weather conditions impact accident rates?  

## 📂 Data Understanding and Analysis  
**Source of Data:** [https://github.com/Salrahim21/dsc-phase-1-project-v3/blob/master/data/Aviation_Data.csv]  
**Data Description:** These are the columns of the data set ['Event.Id', 'Investigation.Type', 'Accident.Number', 'Event.Date',
       'Location', 'Country', 'Airport.Code', 'Airport.Name',
       'Injury.Severity', 'Aircraft.damage', 'Registration.Number', 'Make',
       'Model', 'Amateur.Built', 'Number.of.Engines', 'Engine.Type',
       'Purpose.of.flight', 'Total.Fatal.Injuries', 'Total.Serious.Injuries',
       'Total.Minor.Injuries', 'Total.Uninjured', 'Weather.Condition',
       'Broad.phase.of.flight', 'Report.Status', 'Publication.Date'],
The above is what we used to model the visuals below 

### 🔍 Key Visualizations  
1. **Aircraft Manufacturer vs. Accident Count**⚠️
2. **Accidents by Country**  🌍
3. **Flight Phase vs. Accident Severity**  🛫
The dashboard link is as given [https://github.com/Salrahim21/dsc-phase-1-project-v3/blob/master/data/Dashboard.png] to capture the above visuals.

## 📌 Conclusion  
### ✈️ Key Findings  
1. The **Cessna** aircraft type has the highest accident rate, while **grumman** has the lowest.  
2. **Landing and Takeoff phases** are the riskiest, contributing to most severe accidents.  
3. **Adverse weather conditions** significantly increase accident severity.
